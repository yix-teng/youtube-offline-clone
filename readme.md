## Background
This challenge started when we had to bring our 3 year old on a holiday trip.
He prefers to watch videos via youtube app vs using a video player (i know right?). To save overseas data plan cost and also allowing him to watch videos on the plane, I had to create an app that looks like youtube, but serve videos that is on the phone (offline mode).


## Tech Stack
Tech stack is built on React Native hence should work on both iOS and Andriod. But I've only tested on Andriod.
